## Brainer

*Brainer* is an SRS flash-card app, presenting the user with question cards on topics of their choice. 

The app is at an early stage of front-end design, experimenting with a Tinder-like interface, utilising swipe actions to uncover cards.
-cards are swiped up (moderate difficulty), down (to re-see), right (easy) and left (hard)
-a tap action will flip the card to expose the reverse side answer

# Further work
- implement card deck view in a home screen so select from multiple card decks
- ... card create and editing options
- ... movement tweaks
- ... card display frequency algorithm improvements
- ... and the usual bug fixing
