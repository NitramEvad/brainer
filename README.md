## Brainer

*Brainer* is an SRS flash-card app, presenting the user with question cards on topics of their choice. 

The app is at an early stage of front-end design, using mock data and experimenting with a Tinder-like interface, utilising swipe actions to uncover cards.
- cards are swiped up (moderate difficulty), down (to re-see), right (easy) and left (hard)
- a tap action will flip the card to expose the reverse side answer

### Further work
- implement card deck view in a home screen so select from multiple card decks
- ... card create, delete and editing options
- ... movement tweaks
- ... card flip animation
- ... card display frequency algorithm improvements
- ... expand range of languages for card details
- ... add image and audio files to cards
- ... plus a multitude of bug fixes
